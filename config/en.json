    "description": "The creative exhibition “I Ru” combines the power of sound with that of images and from 5th to 9th November it will be on display at Higshi Yuenchi Park, Urban Picnic “Lounge” Kano-cho 6-5-1, Chuo-ku, Kobe City\n\nMonday to Friday: 11:00am-7:00pm (Monday from 4.00pm)\nSaturday: 9:00am-1:00pm\n\n<b>Photography:</b> The photographer, Lauris Viksne, took 37 photos altogether in Tokyo, Japan (27th to the 28th of July) and in Rīga, Latvija  (2nd September to the 7th October). \n\n<b>The subjects:</b> choristers from Youth Choir BALSIS (Riga, Latvia) and from SCATOLA DI VOCE (Tokyo, Japan). More about the choirs: <a href=/info/balsis>BALSIS</a> and <a href=/info/scatola_di_voce>SCATOLA DI VOCE.</a>\n\n⠀<b>During the exhibition, the following can be heard:</b> <a href=/info/put_vejini>BLOW YE WINDS!</a>. This is a Latvian folk song, arranged by Jurjānu Andrejs. The Japanese song, <a href=/info/furusato>FURUSATO</a>, is by Teiichi Okano and Tatsuyuki Takano.\n\n<b>Sung by:</b> BALSIS and SCATOLA DI VOCE choristers – together and individually. The recordings were completed in Japan from the 1st to the 30th September and in Latvia from the 7th to 15th October.\n\n<b>Symbols:</b> Ancient Latvian signs have served for centuries as bearers of symbolic meaning, explaining the close connection between nature and man. Practical applications appear  on everyday objects, on clothing and in rituals. The message encoded in the symbols is rooted in Baltic mythology and is associated with protection, well-being, and spirituality. Several symbols represent Baltic and Latvian deities. Transcending the boundaries of time, the symbolic meaning of signs is still alive and is used in jewellery and clothing, design and architecture, rituals and works of art, even in the art of tattooing. They have become symbols of national identity, which keep traditions alive, help preserve cultural and historical heritage and pass on information to future generations.\n\n<b>Haiku:</b> When creating the exhibition, Arvis Ostrovskis used the signs and ideographic characters to create a message – which took the form of a specific type of poetry, one which is recognisable in Latvian and Japanese culture. Highlighting through the combination of the rhythm of conventional haiku and its traditional 17 syllables and layers of philosophical context and explanation, snapshots are created that form clear references to the harmonious connection between man and nature. These in themselves become a balance point between what is visually presented and what is orally sung and help to explain the essence of the exhibition.\n\n<b>The creative team:</b> the exhibition’s originator, BALSIS conductor Ints Teterovskis; curator and haiku author Arvis Ostrovskis; photographer Lauris Viksne; project manager Emilija Ruta Ozolina; expert in Latvian symbols and Japanese translation Ugis Nastevics; English translation Ilona Bruveris, sound designer Gustavs Erenpreiss, DevOps engineer Jēkabs Leinis, BALSIS choristers; SCATOLA DI VOCE choristers and conductor Yasuna Kondo.\n\n<b>THE EXHIBITION’S HANDBOOK\n\nTo fully enjoy the exhibition you need:</b>\n\nA smartphone\n\nAn internet connection\n\nQR code reader*\n\nEach photo has a QR code, which you can activate to hear the voice of the chorister in the picture.\n\nThe full recording of the songs will play continuously in the room and the voice of the chorister you have activated will sound on your smartphone, if you have turned on the sound. \n\nAlong with the audio, the QR code activates the name of the chorister, the translation of the accompanying symbol and the haiku.\n\n* if there are difficulties activating the QR code on the photos using the smartphone’s inbuilt reader, please download any QR code reader available on Google Play or App Store.\n\nOur thanks for their contribution to the creation of the exhibition goes to:\n\nRiga City Municipal Council, Kobe City Council, Latvian Investment and Development Agency and  Riga Wood Baltic Pty. Ltd.\n\nThe exhibition uses ancient Latvian symbols and Japanese Chinese characters. The content and meaning of these has been elucidated through reference to the mythology and ethnography of both, corroborating the countries’ cultural heritage. The sounding photo exhibition is apolitical and there is no intention to express any specific ideological, religious or social views.\n\nFurther information is available from <a href=https://www.balsis.lv>balsis.lv</a>",

    "description": "For more than thirty-seven years, the Youth Choir BALSIS (founded in 1987) has proven its enduring artistic quality and won recognition in Latvia and abroad. The choir's creative approach to a cappella choral music makes every concert an event, as evidenced by the 27  international awards it has received. BALSIS has performed Latvian choral music reaching from Europe to Japan, China, Australia and the USA.\n\nThe choir performs with equal dedication in concert halls at a city or national level, international choral festivals and competitions (for example, Lund Choir Festival in Sweden, 2012; The World Choral Expo, 2015 in Macau, China; the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing, 2004 and 2017, at the 39th Takarazuka International Chamber Choir Competition and the 6th Tokyo International Choir Competition, 2024 and beyond), as well as sharing the stage with such world-renowned ensembles as The King's Singers (2008) and Voces8 (2022).\n\nBALSIS has realised countless charitable and social projects, focusing on helping children in orphanages and people with special needs (for example, A Warm Christmas, Gift the World, BALSIS in sign language and other projects).\n\nIts charismatic conductor, Ints Teterovskis, who is also a principal conductor of the Latvian Song Celebration, has been artistic director BALSIS for more than 25 years. Under his leadership, the choir has given about seventy concerts every year and has recorded more than 12 albums. Teterovskis and the choir regularly encourage composers to create new pieces, paying special attention to the choral song cycle genre. BALSIS likes to participate in experimental and contemporary projects, as well as performing in unusual places, such as markets, railway stations, swimming pools, on cruise ships and outdoors on the river.",

Based in Saitama in Japan, the choir participates in events in various locations such as small concerts at city festivals and schools, national competitions which are held annually, and holding their own concerts.\n\nThe choir was named after their ideal image of a choir as a scatola di voce meaning a box of voices in Italian. The choir strives for a sound where each voice retains its own personality, but together they form perfect harmony, like a treasure box filled with colourful voices.\n\nSCATOLA DI VOCE strives for high artistic quality in choral music, working to improve the vocal technique of each chorister to achieve the perfect sound. This goal brings joy to every listener at every performance. Their smiling faces make the choir especially terrific. The repertoire is carefully chosen without compromising on quality, and this is highly appreciated by the audience. The choir has won the Gold Prize at the 76th All Japan Choral Competition and the Gold Prize at the 3rd Tokyo International Choral Competition.\n\nThey make people happy with their singing - this is their simple but big dream. To fulfill this dream, the choristers themselves also enjoy each performance - more than anyone else.",

When they sing Furusato, they think of their home towns, parents who are still there, friends, the mountains, seas, rivers and all the memories that have been created there. \nIn the New Year of 2024, a major earthquake struck the Noto region. Many people were affected by the disaster and faced serious challenges. When the Japanese think of these people, they naturally sing Furusato”. With the help of this song, Japanese people share the challenges and together they pray for recovery and renewal.\n\n<b>Song lyrics</b>\n\nThe mountain where I chased rabbits\nThe river where I fished small carp\nDreams of these still surround me\nThe home village that I cannot forget \n\nHow are my parents keeping now\nAre my old friends happy and healthy?\nIn wind or rain wind, I cannot help\nremembering my home village\n\nWhen my ambitions have been realised\nSomeday I must return home\nThe mountains are verdant in the place of my birth\nThe water is pure in the place of my birth\n",

    "description": "The ancient wedding song of the Līvs, about a man who goes by boat to Courland to collect his beloved, has become a national symbol of Latvia and an expression of the nation's identity. For more than a century, this choral piece in four parts, arranged by Jurjānu Andrejs, has played the role of unifier and resistance fighter. During periods of oppression, it was also played instead of the banned national anthem. People have always found the interpretation of the words of the song challenging, as it seemed to reveal some unflattering qualities of the Latvian people. History, however, has confirmed the true interpretation of the words – which focuses on relying on nature, striving to achieve goals- with the power of the wind at your back, overcoming difficulties, rediscovering and not being afraid to challenge - the importance of independence and standing by one’s words and actions.  Centuries of oppression have resulted in the encoding in the lyrics of the song an emphasis on Latvians having control of their own destiny.\n\n<b>Song lyrics</b>\n\nBlow ye winds and drive my boat\nSend me on to Courland. \n\nA Courish woman promised me\nHer daughter, a deft worker, for my bride. \n\nPromises, promises, but she broke her promise.\nShe said I was a drunkard.\n\nShe said I was a drunkard\nAnd a reckless horse racer. \n\nWhich tavern did I ever drink dry?\nWhose horse did I race into the ground?\n\nI drank on my own tab\nAnd raced my own horse.\n",
